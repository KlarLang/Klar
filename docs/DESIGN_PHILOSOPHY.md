# Klang Design Philosophy

Klang is built on a simple belief:

Ambiguity is more dangerous than verbosity.

---

## What Klang Refuses to Do

- Guess developer intent
- Correct code silently
- Infer semantics without declaration
- Optimize for brevity at the cost of clarity

---

## Defaults Are Moral Choices

Klang defaults to strict mode because defaults shape behavior.

A permissive default leads to fragile systems.
A strict default encourages discipline and clarity.

---

## On Lenient Mode

Lenient mode is not a recommendation.
It is an escape hatch.

Using lenient mode is an explicit acknowledgment
that some guarantees are being sacrificed.

---

## Long-Term Vision

Klang aims to:
- age well
- scale cognitively
- support large, long-lived systems

It prioritizes understanding over convenience.
